### Co-founder Private Repository Enhancements (Day 3)

**Objective:** Finalize the features for the secure co-founder repository page.

**Key Implementations & Bug Fixes:**

1.  **Trust Framework Viewer:**
    *   Created `TrustFrameworkViewer.tsx`, a new read-only component to display the NDA content.
    *   Integrated it into `Co-FounderPrivateRepository.tsx` using a `Collapsible` component from shadcn/ui.
    *   This allows users who have already accepted the NDA to review the terms without seeing the acceptance form again, improving the user experience.

2.  **Embedded YouTube Video Player:**
    *   Created a new, responsive `EmbeddedVideoPlayer.tsx` component to display a YouTube video.
    *   The component was placed at the end of the page, visible only after NDA acceptance.

3.  **Troubleshooting & Bug Fixes:**
    *   **CSP Violation:** The initial implementation was blocked by the Content Security Policy (CSP). The error was `Refused to frame 'https://www.youtube.com/'`.
    *   **Solution:** We correctly identified that the CSP was defined in a `<meta>` tag within `index.html`. We updated the `frame-src` and `media-src` directives to include `https://www.youtube.com`.
    *   **Connection Error:** After fixing the CSP, a new error "youtube.com closed the connection" appeared.
    *   **Solution:** We diagnosed that the embed URL contained an unnecessary `?si=` parameter. We corrected the `videoSrc` in `EmbeddedVideoPlayer.tsx` to use the clean `https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID` format, which resolved the final issue.

**Outcome:** The co-founder private repository is now feature-complete, providing a secure and rich user experience for potential partners, including document access, NDA review, and a video presentation. The collaboration was highly successful, demonstrating effective pair-programming and problem-solving.
