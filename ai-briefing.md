### Co-founder Private Repository Enhancements (Day 3)

**Objective:** Finalize the features for the secure co-founder repository page.

**Key Implementations & Bug Fixes:**

1.  **Trust Framework Viewer:**
    *   Created `TrustFrameworkViewer.tsx`, a new read-only component to display the NDA content.
    *   Integrated it into `Co-FounderPrivateRepository.tsx` using a `Collapsible` component from shadcn/ui.
    *   This allows users who have already accepted the NDA to review the terms without seeing the acceptance form again, improving the user experience.

2.  **Embedded YouTube Video Player:**
    *   Created a new, responsive `EmbeddedVideoPlayer.tsx` component to display a YouTube video.
    *   The component was placed at the end of the page, visible only after NDA acceptance.

3.  **Troubleshooting & Bug Fixes:**
    *   **CSP Violation:** The initial implementation was blocked by the Content Security Policy (CSP). The error was `Refused to frame 'https://www.youtube.com/'`.
    *   **Solution:** We correctly identified that the CSP was defined in a `<meta>` tag within `index.html`. We updated the `frame-src` and `media-src` directives to include `https://www.youtube.com`.

### Forgot Password Feature Implementation (Day 4)

**Objective:** To implement a secure and user-friendly "Forgot Password" flow for users.

**Key Implementations:**

1.  **Backend & SMTP Configuration:**
    *   Configured Firebase Authentication to use a custom SMTP server (Gmail) for sending password reset emails.
    *   Navigated the complexities of the Google Workspace Admin console to enable the necessary settings for generating an "App Password". This involved enabling "Less secure app access" for the user.
    *   Generated a 16-digit App Password from the user's Google Account security settings.
    *   Successfully configured and saved the SMTP credentials (`smtp.gmail.com`, port `587`, `STARTTLS`) in the Firebase console.

2.  **Frontend Page Creation & Logic:**
    *   Created a new page component `src/pages/ForgotPassword.tsx`.
    *   Designed a UI consistent with the project's theme using `shadcn/ui` components (`Card`, `Input`, `Button`).
    *   Implemented the core logic using the `sendPasswordResetEmail` function from the `firebase/auth` SDK.

3.  **User Experience & Routing:**
    *   Integrated the project's `toast` notification system (`sonner`) to provide clear, non-blocking feedback for success and error states (e.g., "email sent" or "user not found").
    *   Added a loading state to the submit button to give the user visual feedback during the request.
    *   Added a new route for `/forgot-password` in the main `App.tsx` router.
    *   Verified that the link to the new "Forgot Password" page was already correctly implemented in the `LoginForm.tsx` component, completing the user flow.
